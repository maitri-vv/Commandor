## Troubleshooting

### Command not found

If you get "commandor: command not found":

1. **Check if the package is installed:**
   ```bash
   pip show commandor
   ```

2. **Check your PATH:**
   ```bash
   echo $PATH
   ```

3. **Find where pip installs scripts:**
   ```bash
   python -m site --user-base
   ```

4. **Add to PATH if needed (add to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`):**
   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:$(python -m site --user-base)/bin"
   ```

### API Key Issues

- Make sure your `.env` file contains: `GEMINI=your_actual_api_key`
- Verify the API key is valid at [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- Check that the `.env` file is in your home directory or current working directory
